# TOR2E Character Tracker

A single-file HTML5 character sheet for **The One Ring 2nd Edition** RPG, designed for iPad/iPhone use as a Progressive Web App.

---

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Replace the paper TOR2E character sheet with a touch-friendly app that enforces the rules and auto-applies mechanical effects.

**Target devices**: iPad, iPhone (Safari → Add to Home Screen)

**Status**: Rule-faithful character creation + play tracking. All starting picks (Culture, Calling, Patron, Distinctive Features, Favoured Skills, Starting Reward, Starting Virtue) drive the sheet automatically. XP-gated upgrades for skills/profs/Valour/Wisdom. Reward auto-apply to equipment with stat modifications + roll-modifier integration.

## Architecture

### Current state (verify before quoting — figures drift)

Last verified: **2026-05-29**. Re-run these three commands to refresh:

```bash
wc -lc character-tracker.html              # file size + line count
grep CACHE_VERSION sw.js                    # current service worker cache version
grep -o "tor2e-[a-z0-9-]*" character-tracker.html | sort -u   # all localStorage keys
```

As of last verification:
- **`character-tracker.html`**: 10,575 lines / ~582 KB
- **`sw.js` `CACHE_VERSION`**: `tor2e-v34` (bump on every deploy)
- **SW strategy (since v30)**: HTML/navigations are **network-first** (deploys appear on next online load — no stale-cache lag); static assets cache-first. Updates surface a tap-to-update banner (page posts `SKIP_WAITING`); still bump `CACHE_VERSION` each deploy so old caches are GC'd.
- **Moria Solo Mode**: ✅ complete (one toggle `⛏️ Enable Moria Solo Mode` → Band + Battle tabs, Moria oracle generators, full solo campaign). Full subsystem reference in the **"Moria Solo Mode"** section below.
- **localStorage keys (4)**: `tor2e-character-v1` (character state), `tor2e-rolls-v1` (last 30 dice rolls), `tor2e-oracle-history` (last 30 Strider Mode oracle rolls), `tor2e-theme` (`'light'` / `'dark'` / unset = auto)

### Stack
- **Pure HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript** — no frameworks, no build step, no dependencies
- **Single file**: `character-tracker.html` (see Current state above for size)
- **Storage**: `localStorage` — see Current state above for the full key list

### Why single-file?
- Works offline from iOS Files app (no web server needed)
- "Add to Home Screen" with zero config
- One file to AirDrop / back up / sync via iCloud
- No ES module / CORS issues on `file://` protocol

### File structure (within `character-tracker.html`)
1. `<head>` — viewport, PWA meta tags, theme color
2. `<style>` — CSS with variables for theming + readonly state styling
3. `<header>` — sticky nav with character name + tabs (scrollable)
4. `<section.panel>` — **11 tabs**: Character / Skills / Combat / Journey / Council / Gear / Dice / **Oracle** / **Band** / **Battle** / Build. Oracle is shown in any solo mode; **Band & Battle are Moria-only** (gated by `char.moriaMode` in `refreshStriderUI`). Journey & Council are always present.
5. **Overlay modals** — Menu, Weapon/Armour/Shield pickers, Spend XP, New Reward, New Virtue, Apply Reward To, Prowess TN, +1-Attribute (`kings-overlay`, Rangers/High Elves), Hoard roller, FP wizard, milestone/desperate-stand/kingly-gift pickers
6. `<script>` — at the bottom

### Data constants in `<script>`
- `SKILLS` — 18 skills grouped by attribute

- `REWARDS` — 6 starting rewards with type + description
- `VIRTUES_GENERIC` — 6 generic virtues with effect data

- `FLAWS_BY_PATH` — 6 shadow paths × 4 escalating flaws
- `PATRONS` — 6 starting patrons with FP bonus + ability + agenda
- `CULTURES` — **11 cultures**: 6 Core + 3 Peoples of Wilderland (Beornings, Elves of Mirkwood, Woodmen) + 2 Other (Dwarves of Nogrod & Belegost, High Elves of Rivendell). Each: blessing, attribute sets, skills, profs, derived stat bonuses, distinctive features. Both Dwarf cultures share `isDwarfCulture()` (Redoubtable load-halving + no great-weapon/shield). High Elves & Rangers share the +1-Attribute overlay (`kings-overlay`, retitled per culture). High Elf EA base = 3.
- `CALLINGS` — 6 core callings + **5 Moria Shared Callings** (`shared:true`: Reclaimers/Pathfinders/Standard-Bearers/Guardians/Vanguards) → favoured skills, feature (Disposition Focus for shared), shadow path
- **Moria Solo constants** (full reference in the "Moria Solo Mode" section below): `DISPOSITIONS`, `SHARED_CALLINGS`, `ALLY_GIFTS`/`ALLY_QUIRKS`/`ALLY_NAMES`, injury/fatigue/burden tables, `MISSION_OBJECTIVES`/`COMP_*`/`HUNT_MOD_*`, `WAR_PARTY`/`ARCHFOE_MODS`/`CLASH_SETBACK`/`BATTLEFIELD_ASPECTS`, `MORIA_JOURNEY_EVENTS`/`MORIA_EVENT_DETAILS`, `CHAMBER_*`/`REVELATION_MORIA`/`ORC_BAND_*`, `MORIA_LORE` (4-col), `MORIA_EXP_MILESTONES`/`FP_INTERRUPTIONS`. Mode helpers: `isMoria()`/`isSolo()`/`oracleSet()`/`isDwarfCulture()`; band helpers: `missionAllies()`/`bandRoll()`/`bandWeary()`.
- `XP_COST_TO_REACH` — `[0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 26, 30]` — in-game costs (cost to reach each rank)
- `SKILL_PE_COST` — `[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 0, 0]` — creation-time Previous Experience cost for skills (cap rank 4)
- `PROF_PE_COST` — `[0, 2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]` — creation-time PE cost for combat profs (cap rank 3)
- `PE_BUDGET = 10` — Previous Experience point budget at creation
- `STANCE_INFO` — descriptions for 4 combat stances
- `DEFAULT_CHARACTER` — full character schema

### Major JS function groups
- State: `loadCharacter` (with migration) / `saveCharacter` / `loadHistory` / `saveHistory`
- Rendering: `render`, `renderSkills`, `renderProfs`, `renderWeapons`, `renderDerivedStats`, `renderConditionWarnings`, `renderStance`, `renderFavouredPicker`, `renderFeaturesPicker`, `renderRewardsPicker`, `renderVirtuesPicker`, `renderQuickSkills`, `renderProtectionParry`, `renderHistory`

- [x] Useful Items display on Gear tab (read-only list of selected items)
- [x] **Cultural Virtues rule fix** — Starting Virtue picker shows only generic 6 (per book p.81: cultural unlock at Wisdom 2+). Note added explaining when cultural becomes available.
- [x] Champion Enemy-Lore sub-picker — when Champion calling is applied, 6-button picker (Evil Men/Orcs/Spiders/Trolls/Wargs/Undead) appears in Features card; updates Distinctive Feature text to "Enemy-Lore (Orcs)" instead of "(choose: ...)"
- [x] Weapon restrictions enforcement — Hobbit/Dwarf restricted weapons greyed out with ⚠ in Weapon picker; confirm-override on pick
- [x] **Rangers Kings of Men +1 Attribute** — sub-prompt on Apply Rangers asks which Attribute (Str/Heart/Wits) gets +1; re-derives End/Hope/Parry Max accordingly; reversible if changed
- [x] **Valour / Wisdom roll buttons** — auto-shown at top of Dice tab quick-roll grid; Valour uses Heart TN with Valour-rank success dice; Wisdom uses Wits TN with Wisdom-rank success dice
- [x] **Cultural Blessing auto-Favoured** — Bardings Stout-Hearted auto-Favours all Valour rolls (★ badge); Hobbits Hobbit-Sense auto-Favours all Wisdom rolls (★ badge); shown in dice result summary
- [x] **Combat Proficiency choice at creation** — new picker card on Build tab lets you choose (1) which of your culture's 2 primary profs gets rank 2, and (2) which of all 4 profs gets the +1 (can stack on primary for rank 3). Preserves PE delta when choices change.

### ✅ Playtest fixes (first round — DONE)
- [x] **Starting Gear card on Build tab** — gold-bordered card before Starting Reward links to Combat tab so users equip gear before picking Rewards (which need a target).
- [x] **Hope/Magical/Keen/Brave result tags** — these now appear in the Dice result summary as visible tags (not just in history).
- [x] **WEARY pill next to Current Endurance** — mirrors the DYING pill style; visible when char.weary is set OR auto-condition met. More prominent than the badge on the Weary button.
- [x] **Brave at a Pinch auto-toggle** — when virtue owned AND Weary/Miserable/Wounded, a 🌲 toggle appears in dice roller. ✅ **Fixed to RAW (later patch):** button now sets `diceState.inspired = true` instead of granting flat +2d. Inspired doubles a Hope spend to +2d; no Hope spend = no bonus. See "Brave at a Pinch RAW fix + Inspiration state" entry above and Known Issues for the resolution.

### ✅ Playtest fixes (second round — DONE)
- [x] **Gender field** — dropdown (Male / Female / —) on Character tab next to Name
- [x] **Random Name picker** — 🎲 button next to Name. Pulls from culture-specific male/female lists in `NAMES` data (extracted from book pp.32-43). Adds family name for Hobbits / Bree, patronymic ("son/daughter of X") for Bardings.
- [x] **Piercing Blow tag only on weapon rolls** — added `diceState.isAttack` flag set by `quickRoll` when item is a Combat Proficiency; "Piercing Blow possible" tag suppressed for skill / Valour / Wisdom rolls.

### ✅ Peoples of Wilderland supplement (DONE)
- [x] **3 new cultures added**: Beornings, Elves of Mirkwood, Woodmen of Wilderland
  - Full Cultural Blessing, attribute sets, derived stat formulas, skills, combat profs, distinctive features
  - Grouped under "Peoples of Wilderland" optgroup in the Culture picker
- [x] **18 new cultural virtues** added to `CULTURAL_VIRTUES` (6 per new culture). Effect data filled where mechanical (Brother to Bears +1 End, Staunching Song +1 Hope).
- [x] **New culture name lists** added to `NAMES`. Beornings and Woodmen use bynames/nicknames (no family names). Elves of Mirkwood share Sindarin pool with Elves of Lindon.
- [x] **Beornings "Furious" auto-Favoured** — when char.wounded and rolling a Combat Proficiency attack OR a Protection Roll, the Feat die is automatically Favoured (rolls 2 dice, keep better). Tag shown in result: "[Furious: Favoured]".

### ✅ Character Lifepaths supplement (DONE)
- [x] **36 backstories** (6 per Core Rules culture) in `LIFEPATHS` data. Each has die roll, name, story, suggested Str/Hrt/Wit, favoured skill, 2 distinctive features.
- [x] **12 Major Events** in `MAJOR_EVENTS` data (Eye, 1-10, Rune).
- [x] **Lifepath card on Build tab** — gold-bordered card with two rollers:
  - "🎲 Roll Backstory" — rolls d6 → displays backstory + suggested stats → "Apply" button overwrites attributes, derived stats, culture favoured, distinctive features; appends story to History
  - "🎲 Roll Major Event" — rolls Feat die → displays event → "Apply" button applies effects (Scars+1, PE budget shift, Standard of Living shift, TN adjustments with prompts, Fellowship Rating shift, Endurance/Hope/Parry adjustments, Favoured-skill prompts, Grey Wizard flag)
- [x] **"Favoured by the Grey Wizard"** — when applied, `char.greyWizard = true`. In `rollFeatOnce`, any 1 rolled is automatically treated as 11. Visible in result as "1→11".
- [x] **Only Core Rules cultures have lifepaths** — Wilderland supplement cultures (Beornings, Mirkwood, Woodmen) hide the Lifepath card (no backstory data exists in this supplement for them).

### ✅ Notebook audit fixes (DONE)
- [x] **Shadow Path → Flaws mapping corrected** — original `FLAWS_BY_PATH` was shifted by one column. Per Core Rules p.140: Curse of Vengeance (Champion) = Spiteful/Brutal/Cruel/Murderous; Dragon-Sickness (Treasure Hunter) = Grasping/Mistrustful/Deceitful/Thieving; Lure of Power (Captain) = Resentful/Arrogant/Overconfident/Tyrannical; Lure of Secrets (Scholar) = Haughty/Scornful/Scheming/Traitorous; Path of Despair (Warden) = Troubled/Wavering/Guilt-ridden/Fearful; Wandering-Madness (Messenger) = Idle/Forgetful/Uncaring/Cowardly.
- [x] **Combat Tasks card on Dice tab** — 4 stance-gated buttons. Intimidate Foe (Forward · AWE), Rally Comrades (Open · ENHEARTEN), Protect Companion (Defensive · ATHLETICS), Prepare Shot (Rearward · SCAN). Matching task is highlighted gold when the player picks the right stance; non-matching tasks dimmed. Tapping rolls the underlying skill via `quickRoll` with a `combatTask` label that appears as a tag in the result summary and in roll history (e.g. "Intimidate Foe (Awe)"). Per-task effect reminders inline on each button.
- [x] **XP_COST_TO_REACH table verified against Core Rules p.119** — values `[0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 26, 30]` match the printed table exactly (Rank 1=4, Rank 2=8, Rank 3=12, Rank 4=20, Rank 5=26, Rank 6=30). Verified by rendering the PDF page visually (NotebookLM's text-extracted values were garbled and the AI hallucinated a clean +4 progression of 4/8/12/16/20/24, which is **wrong**). Same cost column applies to Skills, Combat Proficiencies, Valour, and Wisdom. Do not "fix" this table — it is correct as-is.
- [x] **Shadow Tests on Dice tab** — new card with 3 buttons: 🌑 Dread (Valour vs Heart TN), 💰 Greed (Wisdom vs Wits TN), 🔮 Sorcery (Wisdom vs Wits TN). Tapping triggers a Valour/Wisdom roll via `quickRoll` with a `shadowTest` flag. Result summary shows a tag: "Reduce incoming Shadow by N (1 + N icons)" on success or "No reduction — full Shadow gain applies" on failure. Player manually adjusts the Shadow counter on Character tab. Misdeeds cannot be tested (RAW); the hint copy notes this.
- [x] **Harden Will button** in Hope card — clears all current Shadow to 0 and adds +1 permanent Shadow Scar. Disabled when shadow ≤ 0 or when (shadow + scars) ≥ hopeMax (only Bout of Madness can clear at that point). Confirm dialog explains the trade-off. Resets `char._boutPrompted` so future bouts can fire.
- [x] **Scars now count as Shadow for triggers** (per Core Rules p.137: "considered as a normal Shadow point for all purposes" except healing). `renderConditionWarnings` and `checkAutoTriggers` (Miserable + Bout of Madness) now compare `(shadow + scars)` to the appropriate threshold. `adj()` clamps `shadow + scars ≤ hopeMax` so further Shadow gain is blocked once the total cap is hit. If `hopeMax` is reduced below current `shadow + scars`, the overflow trims shadow first then scars.
- [x] **First Aid HEALING roll** — new red-bordered row appears below Injury input only when Wounded + injuryDays > 0. New char fields: `injuryDays` (number set from Severe-injury roll) and `firstAidUsed` (boolean). Roll Healing button fires a Healing skill roll; on success reduces `injuryDays` by `1 + icons` (min 1) and rewrites the Injury text to show the change. On success or fail, the attempt is marked spent. "↺ Reset (next day)" appears after a failed attempt so the player can retry once a day has passed in fiction. Wounded toggle OFF resets both fields.
- [x] **Pierce special damage** (Core Rules p.99) — after a successful attack roll with Swords/Bows/Spears + remaining ✦ icons + Feat < 10 + not Eye/Rune, an orange "🗡️ Pierce: spend 1 ✦" button appears below the result. Tap bumps Feat by +1 (Swords) / +2 (Bows) / +3 (Spears), caps at 10, decrements icons by 1, recomputes outcome/level/total, and re-renders the result. Chains automatically if there are still icons and Feat < 10. New `diceState.pendingPierce` holds the snapshot; `diceState.lastAttackProf` captures the prof on every attack quickRoll.
- [x] **Receive Support seg-buttons** on dice tab — new "Receive Support" 3-segment row (None / +1d / +2d Focus). Adds 1 or 2 success dice to the roll. Result tag shows "🤝 Supported by ally (+1d)" or "🤝 Supported by Focus-holder (+2d)". Auto-resets to None after each roll. Represents the receiving side of the Support action (the supporting ally spends 1 Hope on their own sheet).
- [x] **FP→Hope mini-button** in Hope card next to Fellowship Pts counter — spend 1 FP to gain +1 Hope (RAW: only during rest scenes, players agree on distribution). Confirm dialog shows the FP and Hope deltas. Caps Hope at hopeMax; blocked if Hope already at max or FP = 0.
- [x] **Strider Mode subsystem** — full solo-play variant per *The One Ring – Strider Mode* supplement.
  - **Foundation**: new `char.striderMode` flag + main-menu toggle. When enabled: PE budget 10→15, attribute TN formula 18−Rating (was 20−Rating), Fellowship Rating min 3, auto-adds free `Strider` Distinctive Feature ("Inspired on all Skill rolls while journeying"). Toggling re-runs TN calc on Strength/Heart/Wits.
  - **Eye of Mordor card** (Character tab, visible only in Strider Mode): Eye Awareness counter + Region picker (Border 18 / Wild 16 / Dark 14) + Hunt Threshold display + Revelation banner with auto-trigger when EA ≥ threshold. `resetEyeAwarenessToStarting()` computes from culture (Hobbits/Men 0, Dwarves 1, Dúnedain/Elves 2) + Valour 4+ +1 + per-Famous-item +1. Full 12-entry **Revelation Episode table** (Conflict brews / Safe Haven in peril / etc.) rolled via Feat die.
  - **Oracle tab** (visible only in Strider Mode): Telling Table (yes/no with 5 chance bands), Lore Table (12 Feat-die sections × 6 Success-die rows × Action/Aspect/Focus columns; ~216 distinct word combos), Fortune Table + Ill-Fortune Table (12 entries each). Oracle History card retains the last 30 rolls in dedicated localStorage.
  - **Skirmish stance** (5th stance, visible only in Strider Mode): Ranged-only attacks (−1d); melee weapons can't attack from Skirmish; escape combat with a ranged-attack roll.
  - **Gain Ground combat task** (Skirmish-stance-gated): ATHLETICS (or SCAN) → +1d on next ranged attack +1d per icon.
  - **Patron Quests** picker on Build tab — rolls 1d6 against the matched Patron's 6-entry quest table (6 patrons × 6 quests, per supplement).
  - **Experience Milestones** alternative: "🏆 Award Milestone XP" picker showing 10 milestones (Accept patron mission, Complete journey, Face Noteworthy Encounter, etc.) with the SP/AP award per RAW. `char.experienceMode` records which scheme the player is using.
  - **Backwards-compatible migration** — all new fields default cleanly for existing characters; toggle is opt-in.
  - **Solo Journey Events + Event Detail sub-tables** — when Strider Mode is on, `resolveJourneyEvent` uses the supplement's split ranges (4-7 Mishap / 8-9 Short Cut / 10 Chance-meeting; the core book has Mishap 4-9 and a combined Short-Cut/Chance-meeting at 10). After determining the main event, rolls a Success die for the **Event Detail** sub-table (7 tables × 6 entries each — e.g. "Stalking enemy → AWARENESS to spot the foul presence" under Terrible Misfortune). Sub-table specifies a different skill where appropriate (HUNTING/EXPLORE/AWARENESS) and the displayed `targetSkill` is overridden accordingly. **Noteworthy Encounter** results (Dire confrontation, Servants of the Enemy, Auspicious gathering, Peaceful sanctuary) are flagged with a red ⭐ NOTEWORTHY ENCOUNTER badge in the journey log — resolve as extended scenes with multiple rolls, possibly combat/council/endeavour.

  **Post-audit fixes (added after the 2026-05-27 audit):**
  - **Marching Test auto-rolls TRAVEL in Strider Mode** — `rollMarchingTest()` now skips the "you are not the Guide" manual-entry prompt when `char.striderMode` is true; the lone hero is treated as the de-facto Guide and TRAVEL is rolled inline (Heart TN, full Favoured/Miserable handling).
  - **All journey-event role coverage auto-applies in Strider Mode** — `resolveJourneyEvent()` sets `playerCovers = true` unconditionally when Strider Mode is on, so the "▶ You cover X: roll Y" highlight always fires regardless of which role the sub-table targeted.
  - **Journey Setup roles section hidden in Strider Mode** — the 4-role checkbox group is replaced by a gold-bordered hint explaining "no roles assigned — the lone hero handles all aspects of travel". Toggled by `refreshStriderUI`.
  - ~~**Solo Journey Events standalone roller**~~ — was added to Oracle tab, then moved to Journey tab, then **removed entirely** when the user pointed out it was redundant: `resolveJourneyEvent()` (the existing "🎲 Resolve Event Now" button on the Journey tab) already rolls the full Strider Mode flow — Feat die with the 4-7 Mishap / 8-9 Short Cut / 10 Chance-meeting split, plus the Event Detail Success-die sub-roll with Noteworthy Encounter flagging. The standalone card + `rollSoloJourneyEventStandalone()` function were deleted; users now use the in-journey resolver for both prep-time and in-play rolls (start a throwaway journey if you want to pre-roll).

  **Dark Mode inverted-bg fix (2026-05-27)** — three new semantic vars added because the existing `--ink`, `--red-dark`, `--amber-soft` invert to *lighter* values in dark mode, breaking white-text-on-bg contrast in ~44 sites (cancel buttons, alert badges, WEARY/DYING pills, Ill-Fortune button, NOTEWORTHY ENCOUNTER badges, Visiting-Treasury secondary buttons, etc.):
  - `--btn-secondary-bg` (light `#2a1810` / dark `#1b140d`) — cancel/secondary buttons (was `var(--ink)`)
  - `--btn-alert-bg` (light `#5d0e0e` / dark `#7a1a1a`) — alert/danger backgrounds (was `var(--red-dark)`)
  - `--btn-warn-bg` (light `#a86b00` / dark `#7a4f00`) — warning/amber backgrounds (was `var(--amber-soft)`)
  
  Bulk-replaced via Python: 26 sites of `background:var(--ink)`, 11 of `background:var(--red-dark)`, 7 of `background:var(--amber-soft)`. Also fixed Cancel button `border:1px solid var(--ink)` → `border:1px solid var(--btn-secondary-bg)`. The `color:`, `border-color:`, etc. uses of the original vars are unchanged — they were always correct in both modes.

  **Strider Mode known gaps (audited 2026-05-27 — all 5 settled 2026-05-27):**
  1. ✅ **Special Success spend table** — `renderSpecialSuccessPanel(icons)` appears below the result summary on any Strider-Mode success roll with ≥1 ✦ icon. 6 buttons (Gain Insight / Go Quietly / Make Haste / Widen Influence / Build Advantage / Cancel a Failure) with full tooltips. Spending decrements the icon counter. **Build Advantage** queues `diceState.queuedAdvantage++`, which adds +1d on the next roll (resets after). Other spends log to roll history as narrative.
  2. ✅ **Auto Fortune / Ill-Fortune prompt** — `rollDice()` checks for Rune+success or Eye+fail at the end of a Strider Mode roll and injects a one-tap "🎲 Roll Fortune/Ill-Fortune Table" button below the summary. Tapping rolls inline via the same FORTUNE_TABLE / ILL_FORTUNE_TABLE constants the Oracle tab uses, appends the result as a tag, and (for Fortune Eye/Ill-Fortune Eye) bumps Eye Awareness per supplement.
  3. ✅ **Auto-Inspired during Journey** — `quickRoll()` auto-sets `diceState.inspired = true` with source `'Strider (Journey)'` when `striderMode && journey.active && !isProf && !isMeta` (Skill rolls only). Only fires if the player hasn't already chosen a different Inspired source manually. The Strider Distinctive Feature now actually does something.
  4. ✅ **Eye-Awareness auto-increment hooks** — three sites:
     - `rollDice()` (post-roll): +1 EA when `striderMode && !isAttack && (Eye or Rune)`; +1 EA on Magical Success. Tag shown in result.
     - `adj('shadow', delta>0)`: in Strider Mode, EA rises by the actual Shadow gain (capped by Shadow cap). Player can manually decrement if the Shadow was from combat.
     - `rollAutoFortune`: Fortune Eye → −1 EA; Ill-Fortune Eye → +2 EA per supplement.
  5. ✅ **Fellowship Focus suppression** — `refreshStriderUI()` hides the Focus picker row + the "Spend 1 Hope to support" hint when Strider Mode is on, and surfaces a gold-bordered "no Fellowship Focus — Support action does not apply" hint in its place.
- [x] **Native dialog migration completed (incremental → full)** — 101 → 0 native confirm/prompt calls.
  - **All ~25 remaining `confirm()` calls** swapped to `await confirmStyled(...)` via a Python regex pass; their enclosing functions converted to `async`.
  - **All 6 `prompt()` calls** swapped to `await promptStyled(...)` (new helper added — input modal with OK/Cancel that distinguishes OK from Cancel via `b.cancel: true` on the Cancel button).
  - **3 `setTimeout(() => ...)` callbacks** that contain inline confirms (Bout of Madness flaw picker, SoL auto-promote in `adj`, SoL auto-promote in `hoardTakeTreasureShare`) converted to `setTimeout(async () => ...)`.
  - **1 inline `onclick` arrow** (the Wounded condition toggle in `bindInputs`) converted to `async` for the inline await.
  - **1 function added to async list** (`applyBackstory` — wasn't in the first migration pass).
  - Python audit script verifies all `await` calls live inside async contexts: **0 issues**.
  - **`CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js` bumped from `tor2e-v1` → `tor2e-v2`** so existing PWA users get the styled-dialog version on next visit.
- [x] **Native dialog migration to styled modals** — closes the polished-UI gap (initial pass — 63 alerts + 8 high-impact confirms).
  - **All 63 `alert()` calls** now render as styled modals via a one-shot **`window.alert` monkey-patch**: `_alertQueue` + serial processing → `alertStyled(msg)`. Caller code unchanged (alert is fire-and-forget; sequential alerts queue cleanly). HTML-escape applied so user content can't inject markup; `\n` converted to `<br>`. Native fallback preserved as `window._nativeAlert` for edge cases.
  - **8 high-impact `confirm()` calls migrated** to `confirmStyled` (manually, callers converted to async):
    - `awardSessionXP` (📜 End Session)
    - `hardenWill` (🔥 Harden Will — Shadow → Scar)
    - `cancelCouncil`, `cancelSkillEndeavour`, `endJourney` (cancel-mid-flow dialogs)
    - `arriveAtDestination` (🏁 Journey arrival)
    - `takeShortRest` (☀️ Short Rest)
    - `removeMagicalItem` (destructive)
  - **Remaining ~24 confirms + 6 prompts left native** by design: they appear in low-frequency code paths (build-tab pickers, reset flows, manual marching-test entry, etc.) and converting their callers to async would cascade through many sites with limited UX gain. Future migration is incremental and follows the demonstrated pattern.
  - **Note for service worker bump**: bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js` (currently `'tor2e-v1'`) on next deploy so users get the styled-modal version instead of the cached shell.
- [x] **Cursed Items + Treasure Index** (Core Rules pp.165-167) — closes the last narrative gaps in the Treasure subsystem.
  - **Cursed Items**: Add Magical Item modal gains a "⚠️ Cursed item" checkbox + curse-type dropdown (Shadow Taint / Owned / Marked). On Add: stores `cursed: true` + `curseType` on the item, surfaces the chosen curse-type in a follow-up alert with the RAW consequence. Cursed items render with a 2px red-dark border + ⚠️ CURSED badge (showing curse type) in the magical-items list.
  - **Shadow Taint auto-application in FP wizard**: step 2 now shows a red preview panel listing all Shadow-Tainted items and the +N Shadow that will apply this phase. On Apply Recovery, the taint is added after the player's chosen Shadow Removal, capped at hopeMax−scars per existing Shadow caps. Recovery summary shows the taint gain with the items' names.
  - **Treasure Index**: new `TREASURE_INDEX` constant with 15 canonical Middle-earth items — Glamdring, Orcrist, Sting, Andúril, Bilbo's Mithril Coat, Helm of Hammerhand, Phial of Galadriel, Arkenstone, Horn of Boromir, Elven Cloak, Elven Rope, Cram, Black Arrow, Horn of the Mark, Drinking Horn of Thranduil. Each entry has type, craftsmanship, qualities/blessings (with full RAW descriptions), and lore notes. New "📖 Pick from Treasure Index" button in the Add Magical Item modal opens a picker overlay; selecting an item pre-fills the entire form (type-aware, so Blessings or Famous qualities populate correctly), player can edit anything before tapping Add Item.
- [x] **Comprehensive var-isation of inline hex colours** — completes the dark-mode polish. Added ~13 new semantic vars to `:root` (light) + `body.dark` (dark): `--gold-soft`, `--gold-paler`, `--red-soft`, `--success-bg`, `--success-text`, `--error-bg`, `--error-text`, `--warn-orange`, `--amber-soft`, `--green-soft`, `--brown-soft`, `--text-muted`, `--text-faint`, `--pure-white`, `--rest-blue`, `--warn-yellow`. Replaced ~150 inline hex references throughout the HTML body, JS template strings, and CSS class rules with the semantic vars. Removed the band-aid attribute-selector overrides (`body.dark [style*="background:#fff8e1"]` etc.) that were previously bolting dark mode onto hardcoded panels. Only remaining hex literals are: (1) the icon SVG data URIs in `<link>` tags (intentionally raw — they're inside a URL value); (2) two dark-mode form-control overrides (`background: #1b140d` / `#14100a`) that hard-set form colors against the parchment palette. Result: dark mode now renders consistently across all cards, modals, tags, buttons, and JS-generated UI without per-element overrides.
- [x] **Polish bundle — Brawling + Dark Mode + Styled Modals**:
  - **Brawling proficiency** (Core Rules p.45) — added to the quick-roll grid as a derived prof. Rating = `max(Axes, Bows, Spears, Swords) − 1`, computed live via `getBrawlingRating()`. Not stored in `char.profs`. Shown with a small "(der)" tag and tooltip explaining the derivation. Use for Unarmed / Dagger / Cudgel / Club weapons.
  - **Dark mode** — auto via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` when no manual preference, with a manual toggle button in the main menu ("🌙 Toggle Dark Mode" / "☀️ Toggle Light Mode"). Preference persists in `localStorage` under `tor2e-theme` (`'light'` / `'dark'` / unset = auto). New CSS vars: `--card-bg`, `--ink-soft` joined the existing palette. Dark palette is a Tolkien-esque deep-parchment brown (`#1b140d` / `#261c12` / `#2a1f15` with gold accents `#d4a635` and softened red `#c44545`). Pragmatic overrides catch the most common hardcoded panel hexes (`#fff8e1`, `#f4e8e8`, `#fffaef`, `white`) via attribute selectors; comprehensive var-isation of every inline style remains a follow-up polish. `theme-color` meta updates so the iOS status bar matches.
  - **Styled modal infrastructure** — new `showModal({title, message, buttons[], input?})` Promise-based helper + `confirmStyled(msg)` / `alertStyled(msg)` convenience wrappers. Matches the existing menu-overlay aesthetic, looks better than native iOS alerts. **Honest scope:** the infrastructure is in place; existing native `confirm()`/`alert()`/`prompt()` calls are left as-is to avoid a cascading sync→async refactor. New features should use the styled helpers. Migration of existing dialogs can happen incrementally.
- [x] **Experience awards enforcement** (Core Rules pp.55, 119):
  - **📜 End Session button** in the Character tab Advancement card. Confirm dialog → +3 SP + 3 AP per RAW p.55. Brief recap alert.
  - **`char.fpModeActive` boolean + `char.fpSpend = { skills:{}, profs:{}, valour:0, wisdom:0 }`** — tracks per-current-FP spending. Reset on `openFPWizard`; preserved (but `fpModeActive = false`) on `fpClose`/`fpComplete` so the player can review.
  - **Spend XP modal enforcement**: when `fpModeActive`, each rank purchase is gated through `fpSpendBlocker(group, label)`:
    - Skill: blocks if that Skill was already raised this phase
    - Combat Prof: blocks if that Prof was already raised
    - Valour: blocks if Wisdom was already raised this phase
    - Wisdom: blocks if Valour was already raised
  - Blocked rows show "🔒 FP" with a reason hint underneath. Modal header surfaces an FP-mode banner with current spend summary.
  - **Out of FP mode**: no caps (current looser behaviour preserved), with a hint noting "per RAW XP is only spent in FP — use the FP wizard for rule-correct play".
- [x] **iOS Home Screen icon refreshed** — replaced the basic inline SVG with a richer design: gold One Ring (gradient stroke) on a cream-parchment radial-gradient background, white highlight arc on the upper-left for polished-metal gleam, four small dark-red compass dots at N/E/S/W, "TOR" in bold serif dark red centered, "2E" subtitle below in tracked letter-spacing. Provided three `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` tags (default + sizes="152x152" iPad + sizes="167x167" iPad Pro) plus a `<link rel="icon">` favicon all sharing the same inline data URI. SVG scales perfectly — iOS rasterises it cleanly at any required home-screen size (60/120/180px).

- [x] **Full PWA install (manifest.json + service worker)** — Android Chrome now meets the "Add to Home Screen" install criteria; iOS continues to work via the existing apple-touch-icon path but now also caches offline via the service worker. New sibling files added next to `index.html`:
  - **`manifest.json`** — name, short_name "TOR2E", start_url `./index.html`, scope `./`, display `standalone`, theme/background `#f5ecd9`, 5 icon entries (192/512 PNG with `purpose: any`, 192/512 PNG with `purpose: maskable`, and the SVG with `sizes: any`).
  - **`sw.js`** — cache-first service worker. `CACHE_VERSION = 'tor2e-v1'` (bump on each deploy). Install event pre-caches the 6 critical files; activate cleans up old caches and claims clients. Fetch handler is GET-only, same-origin only, caches successful responses, and falls back to the cached HTML shell when offline + uncached HTML requested.
  - **`icon-192.png`** (42 KB) and **`icon-512.png`** (231 KB) — rasterised from the SVG via `qlmanage` for Android Chrome's "PWA install" criteria (Chrome currently requires raster icons in some Android versions; SVG works for many but PNGs guarantee install eligibility everywhere).
  - **`icon.svg`** (1 KB) — the source SVG, also referenced by manifest with `sizes: "any"` for scalable rendering.
  - **HTML changes**: added `<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">` in head; added a `navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js')` block at the end of the main script, gated on http/https protocol (skipped for file:// previews).

### Deploying on iOS / Android (Add to Home Screen)

**Deploy bundle** — for hosted install, you need these files together at the same path:
- `index.html` (canonical mirror of `character-tracker.html`)
- `manifest.json`
- `sw.js`
- `icon-192.png` · `icon-512.png` · `icon.svg`

**Netlify (recommended):** drop the project folder onto Netlify (or `git push` if you've set up a git-linked site). All 6 files deploy as a unit; the service worker auto-registers on first visit.

**iOS Safari install:** open the deployed URL → Share → Add to Home Screen → confirm. Launches standalone (no Safari chrome) thanks to `apple-mobile-web-app-capable=yes`. The apple-touch-icon SVG renders crisp at 60/120/180px. Offline works after first load (SW caches the shell + manifest + icons; localStorage persists character data across launches).

**Android Chrome install:** open the deployed URL → Chrome surfaces an "Install app" prompt (or use the ⋮ menu → "Add to Home screen"). Manifest + working SW + maskable icons satisfy the installable-PWA criteria. Same offline behaviour.

**Direct / file:// preview:** open `index.html` from iCloud Drive or local disk; everything works *except* the service worker (browsers block SW registration on `file://`). For just-on-this-device use, iOS Add-to-Home-Screen still works from Files-app-launched Safari and uses the apple-touch-icon — offline is then handled by Safari's normal page cache + localStorage.

**Updating the deployed bundle:** when you push new code, bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js` (e.g. `'tor2e-v2'`) so old clients drop their stale shell and pull the new one on next visit. The activate handler garbage-collects the old caches.
- [x] **Famous Weapon dormant qualities flow** (Core Rules pp.162-165) — extends Treasure subsystem:
  - New `ENCHANTED_REWARDS` constant catalog: 7 Enchanted Rewards (Ancient/Superior Cunning Make, Cleaving, Flame of Hope, Foe-Slaying, Superior Fell, Reflective) + 6 ordinary Rewards (Close-fitting, Cunning Make, Fell, Grievous, Keen, Reinforced). Each has a condensed RAW description.
  - **Add Magical Item modal — Famous variant** now shows a 3-slot quality picker. Slot 1 is gold-bordered with "ACTIVE on find" badge; slots 2-3 are grey "DORMANT". Each slot has a dropdown (auto-fills name + description from the catalog) plus name and description text inputs for custom entries.
  - **Saved on item:** `qualities: [{ name, description, active }]`. First quality auto-active. Load-time migration backfills `qualities: []` on pre-existing Famous items.
  - **Display:** the magical-items list now renders each Famous item's qualities as colored rows (gold/active vs grey/dormant) with description lines. If any dormant exist, a "🔓 Unlock Next Dormant Quality (N left)" button appears.
  - **Manual unlock**: tap the Unlock button → prompt explains the two RAW methods (new Valour rank or Visiting the Treasury), player enters 1 or 2 → next dormant quality flips to active, confirmation alert.
  - **Fellowship Phase wizard integration**: when "Visiting the Treasury" is one of the chosen undertakings, fpComplete now surfaces a picker listing all Famous items with dormant qualities. Player picks one to unlock; quality activates and FP completion log records the gift + activation. If no Famous items have dormant qualities, falls back to narrative-only with an explanatory log entry.
- [x] **Treasure subsystem** — Magical Treasure framework per Core Rules pp.158-167. New `char.magicalItems[]` data model (with `{type, name, blessings, craftsmanship, notes}`) + load migration. New gold-bordered "✨ Magical Treasure" card on the Gear tab with item list + Roll Hoard / Add Magical Item buttons.
  - **🎲 Hoard Roller modal**: tier picker (Lesser/Greater/Marvellous) with correct dice counts per RAW (1/2/3 Success dice × party size for Treasure; 2/4/6 Feat dice for magical), party size input, ⚠️ Tainted Hoard toggle. Rolls Treasure points (per-hero share displayed), rolls Magical Treasure dice (Eye/Rune = magical find; Success die determines type 1-3 Marvellous Artefact / 4-5 Wondrous Item / 6 Famous Weapon). "Take My Share" button awards Treasure (uses SoL auto-promote logic). "Take Item" button per find launches the Add Magical Item modal pre-populated with type + tainted flag.
  - **+ Add Magical Item modal**: type dropdown, name, craftsmanship dropdown (Mannish/Elven/Dwarven/Númenórean variants), Blessing skill picker(s) — 1 for Marvellous, 2 for Wondrous, none for Famous (recorded in Notes), tainted-hoard checkbox. On Add: appends to `char.magicalItems`, adds +1 Load via `otherLoad`. If tainted: prompts for Greed Shadow Test (Wisdom vs Wits TN, +1/+2/+3 Shadow by type per RAW p.158); success reduces gain by 1+icons. Both test+full-gain options surfaced.
  - **Auto +2d on Blessing match in `quickRoll`**: when rolling a Skill matched by an owned Marvellous/Wondrous item's Blessing, success dice +2 and a "✨ {item} Blessing +2d" tag appears in result. Magical Success becomes available for that roll per RAW.
  - **Magical item list display** on Gear tab: emoji-tagged (✨ / 💎 / ⚔️), shows type/craftsmanship/Blessings/notes, × button to remove (also reduces Load by 1).
  - **Honest scope:** Famous Weapon/Armour dormant qualities and Visiting Treasury unlock flow are narrative-only (notes field). Treasure Index (Loremaster pre-prepared item list) not modeled. Cursed Items (Shadow Taint, Owned) not modeled mechanically — narrative only.
- [x] **Combat polish bundle** — three combat features per Core Rules pp.93-99:
  - **Foe Parry input on Combat tab** — counter next to Engaged Foes. Stored in `diceState.foeParry`. When an attack roll fires (`isAttack`), effective TN = `strTN + foeParry`. Result summary shows the breakdown: "vs TN 16 (14 Str + 2 Foe Parry)".
  - **Two-handed grip toggle on War Gear** — versatile weapons (Long Sword, Spear, Long-hafted Axe — those with "/" in Injury) now store `inj1h` and `inj2h` separately. A small grip toggle button appears next to the weapon name on the War Gear row: tap to swap between 1h (lower Injury, may use shield) and 2h (higher Injury, no shield Parry bonus). The Injury column auto-updates; weapon notes are annotated with `(currently 1h/2h)`.
  - **🏃 Fly, You Fools! button** in the Stance card. Opens a 2-choice prompt explaining RAW p.95 escape rules: (1) Rearward stance = auto-escape on next turn no roll, (2) Defensive stance = attack roll, success = escape with no damage dealt, failure = remain engaged. Picking either sets the stance automatically.
- [x] **Brave at a Pinch RAW fix + Inspiration state** — per Core Rules p.20: Inspired doubles the +1d Hope bonus to +2d; Inspired alone (no Hope spend) has no effect. Replaced `diceState.brave` (old +2d flat, no Hope cost) with `diceState.inspired` + `diceState.inspiredSource` ('Brave at a Pinch' | 'Distinctive Feature'). Bonus math: `hopeBonus = hopeSpend ? (inspired ? 2 : 1) : 0`. Updated UI: Brave at a Pinch button now reads "🌲 Brave at a Pinch — Inspired (next Hope spend = +2d)" and only shows when Bardings virtue + Weary/Miserable/Wounded conditions are met; added a new "✨ Invoke Distinctive Feature — Inspired (next Hope spend = +2d)" button always visible below it (RAW: DF invocation is a generic Inspiration source). Result summary shows green Inspired tag when both Inspired and Hope-spend are active, or a grey "no Hope spent, so no bonus this roll" hint when Inspired but no Hope is spent. History label uses the source emoji (🌲 or ✨). Reset cleanly at end of each roll.
- [x] **Resting buttons** (Core Rules p.71) — two buttons under the Endurance counters on Character tab:
  - **☀️ Short Rest** (orange) — recovers `+STRENGTH` Endurance (capped at Max). Blocked entirely if Wounded ("no Endurance recovered" per RAW). Confirm dialog shows the projected End delta.
  - **🌙 Prolonged Rest** (blue) — recovers full Endurance (or `+STRENGTH` only if Wounded), plus +1 Hope if Hope was at 0. If `char.fatigue > 0`, asks "Are you resting in a Safe Haven?" and clears 1 Fatigue on Yes (per RAW: lingering Travel Fatigue clears 1/Prolonged Rest in a Safe Haven only). Recap alert shows the changes.
- [x] **SoL auto-promote** — when `char.treasure` crosses a Standard-of-Living threshold (30/90/180/300 per Core Rules p.73), `adj()` prompts to upgrade. Only promotes upward; never auto-downgrades. Uses `SOL_THRESHOLDS` and `SOL_RANK` constants.
- [x] **Give-side Support button** — "🤝 Support Ally" mini-button below Hope counter on Character tab. Confirm dialog notes the +1d default and +2d if the supporter has the ally as Fellowship Focus, decrements Hope by 1. Mirrors the existing Receive Support seg-buttons on the dice tab.
- [x] **4-Flaws-succumb enforcement** (Core Rules p.141) — Bout of Madness handler now detects whether all 4 path Flaws are already present in `char.flaws`. If yes, the hero succumbs instead of getting another bout: sets `char.retired = true` + `retiredReason`, surfaces a culture-aware fate message (Elves → "sailed for Valinor", others → "lost to madness"), and shows a permanent **RETIRED** pill in the header next to the character name. The bout flaw-picker also now excludes already-owned flaws (so the player can't accidentally double up). Bout trigger guard skips entirely when `char.retired` is true (no further bouts after retirement).
- [x] **Skill Endeavour tracker** — added as a second section on the Council tab (below the Council cards, separated by a gold divider labelled "Skill Endeavour"). Full prolonged-task system per Core Rules p.131. New `char.skillEndeavour` object: {active, task, resistance, timeLimit, riskLevel, attemptsUsed, successesScored, rolls[], outcome}. Backwards-compatible load migration. Three cards:
  - **Setup**: task text, Resistance 3-segment (Simple 3 / Laborious 6 / Daunting 9) with rule hints, Time Limit 4-segment (3 Not enough / 4 Short / 5 Enough / 6 Plenty), Risk Level 3-segment (Standard / Hazardous / Foolish) with consequence hints.
  - **Active**: two progress bars, full 18-skill picker grid (str/hrt/wit skills with rating + Favoured highlight), Roleplay Bonus picker (None / +1d / +2d, resets after each attempt). Each successful attempt contributes `1 + icons`. Failure-with-Woe consequences auto-flagged in roll log when Risk = Hazardous. End-of-Endeavour outcomes branch by Risk Level: Standard → Simple Failure OR Success-with-Woe (player choice); Hazardous → Failure-with-Woe (woes already accumulated per failed roll); Foolish → Disaster! (cannot resume).
  - **Log**: scrolling roll history with contribution/woe tags.
  - Reuses `_doInlineRoll` and the same Miserable+Eye handling. Tab name kept as "Council" — happy to rename to "Endeavours" if you'd prefer (both Council and Skill Endeavours fit under the same conceptual umbrella).
- [x] **Council tracker (new Council tab)** — full Social Encounter system per Core Rules pp.104-108. New `char.council` object holds {active, topic, resistance, attitude, introRolled, timeLimit, attemptsUsed, successesScored, rolls[], outcome}. Backwards-compatible load migration. Three cards on a new Council tab:
  - **Setup**: topic text field, Resistance 3-segment (Reasonable 3 / Bold 6 / Outrageous 9) with rule-hint per choice, Audience Attitude 3-segment (Reluctant −1d / Open / Friendly +1d) with rule-hint, Begin button.
  - **Active**: two progress bars (Successes / Resistance + Attempts / Time Limit), Introduction phase with 3 useful-skill buttons (AWE / COURTESY / RIDDLE) — fail sets Time Limit to 3, success to 4 + icons; Interaction phase with 5 useful-skill buttons (ENHEARTEN / INSIGHT / PERSUADE / RIDDLE / SONG) and a 3-segment Roleplay Bonus picker (None / Relevant +1d / Brilliant +2d, resets after each attempt); all rolls auto-apply Attitude as ±1d. Each successful Interaction attempt contributes `1 + icons` toward Resistance. End-of-Council screen surfaces automatically when Resistance is met (auto Success) or time runs out (Accept Failure / Success-with-Woe choice).
  - **Log**: scrolling roll history with intro/contribution tags, success/fail color coding, roleplay-bonus annotation.
  - Uses the shared `_doInlineRoll(successDice, fav, tn)` helper (originally built for Journey) — Miserable+Eye still auto-fails.
- [x] **Fellowship Phase wizard** — 4-step modal (Type → Spiritual Recovery → Updates → Undertakings) per Core Rules pp.117-123.
  - **Step 1 — Type:** Ordinary or Yule. Yule unlocks Yule-only undertakings and triggers extras.
  - **Step 2 — Spiritual Recovery:** auto-recovers +HEART Hope (or full at Yule), prompts for Shadow removal (0/−1/−2/−3 based on Adventuring Phase outcome). Yule extras applied automatically: age +1, +WITS bonus Skill Points, all Hope restored. Resets `activeFPBonuses` (so previous phase's Strengthen Fellowship and Ponder Maps expire) and clears `songs[].used` flags for the next Adventuring Phase.
  - **Step 3 — Updates:** displays current SP/AP pools and reminds player of the RAW caps (1 rank per Skill/Prof, Valour XOR Wisdom). Player closes wizard to use existing Spend XP modals; wizard state is preserved.
  - **Step 4 — Undertakings:** all 10 undertakings shown with FREE-Calling indicator and YULE badge where applicable. Limit enforcement: max 1 main non-Yule + max 1 free non-Yule + any number of Yule-only picks. Mechanical effects applied on Complete: Strengthen Fellowship (+1 FP Rating until next FP), Ponder Maps (sets flag for Journey integration), Heal Scars (−5 AP, −1 Scar), Raise an Heir (configurable AP+Treasure spend → heir PE), Write a Song (adds to `char.songs[]` with type/title/lyrics). Narrative-only undertakings (Gather Rumours, Meet Patron, Study Magical Items, Visiting Treasury, Recount a Story) just log to the completion summary.
  - **Trigger:** "🌿 End Adventuring Phase" gold button in the Advancement card on the Character tab, with a small "active bonuses" status line and a phases-completed counter.
  - **Ponder Maps integration:** when `activeFPBonuses.ponderMaps` is true, Journey event Feat die gets +1 (Eye → Despair, otherwise +1 to numeric value, capped at 10; Rune unaffected). Event log shows "🗺️ Ponder Maps +1" tag.
- [x] **Journey tracker (new tab)** — full Adventuring-Phase journey system per Core Rules pp.108-115. New `char.journey` object holds all state (`active`, `origin`, `destination`, `totalHexes`, `hardTerrainHexes`, `currentHex`, `season`, `region`, `forcedMarch`, `mounted`, `mountVigour`, `roles {guide,hunter,lookout,scout}`, `travelFatigue`, `daysElapsed`, `events[]`, `nextEventHex`). Backwards-compatible load migration. Three cards on the Journey tab:
  - **Setup**: origin/destination text, total + hard-terrain hex inputs, Season + Region dropdowns, Forced March + Mounted + Mount Vigour, my-role checkboxes, Start/Cancel buttons.
  - **In Progress**: progress bar showing currentHex/totalHexes, Days Elapsed / Travel Fatigue / Next Event counters, **Marching Test** button (rolls TRAVEL inline as Guide, or prompts manual entry if not Guide — applies hex advance based on success/icons or season-fail rules; advances days incl. hard-terrain bonus; Forced March halves time and adds Fatigue), **Resolve Event** button (enabled when at next event hex — rolls success die for target role/skill, rolls region-modified Feat die for the event from p.112 table: Terrible Misfortune/Despair/Ill Choices/Mishap/Short Cut/Joyful Sight — applies +Fatigue, surfaces effect description, highlights whether you cover the targeted role), **Arrive at Destination** (mount Vigour reduction → TRAVEL roll → lingering Fatigue added to character Fatigue counter).
  - **Log**: scrolling event log per journey (day + hex prefix).
  - Inline `_doInlineRoll(successDice, fav, tn)` helper does dice without going through the Dice tab — keeps the player on the Journey tab for the whole journey loop.

### Core Rules coverage matrix (snapshot from 2026-05-23 notebook audit)
Audit cross-referenced the full Core Rules table of contents against the app. Coverage by subsystem:

| Subsystem | App coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Action Resolution / dice | ~99% | ✅ Inspiration as a state (RAW p.20) + Invoke-Distinctive-Feature button added. ✅ Favoured/Ill-Favoured auto-cancellation per RAW p.20 — `effectiveFav()` layers `autoFavSources` + `autoIllSources` against manual pick; matching opposite sources cancel to Normal with hint + result tag. Remaining gap: Repeating-a-Roll rules not enforced (probably correct to leave as player-tracker behaviour). |
| Character Creation | ~98% | ✅ SoL auto-promote added (prompts on Treasure crossing 30/90/180/300). |
| Combat (player side) | ~97% | ✅ Combat Tasks + Pierce + Foe Parry TN modifier + 2-handed grip toggle + Fly You Fools escape added. Still missing: Opening Volleys phase (mostly narrative — the mechanical "double shield Parry vs ranged if aware" applies when the hero is the *target* of a volley, which the player-side tracker doesn't model directly). |
| Conditions | ~95% | |
| Skills | ~95% | |
| Shadow | ~97% | ✅ Shadow Tests + Harden Will + Scars-as-Shadow + 4-flaws-succumb retirement added. ✅ **Despair Ill-Favoured added** — `shadowDespairActive()` makes every Feat die Ill-Favoured (dice tab `quickRoll`/`rollDice` + inline Journey/Council/Endeavour rolls) when Shadow+Scars ≥ Max Hope, layered against Favoured per RAW p.20; result summary shows a "⚠ Ill-Favoured: Despair" tag. Still missing: auto-deduct of Shadow on a successful Shadow Test (player still adjusts the counter manually). |
| Journey | ~88% | ✅ Full Journey tab added. Roles, hex path, Marching Tests, Event Target + Journey Events table, terrain/season modifiers, Forced March, Mounted/Vigour, Arrival TRAVEL roll, lingering Fatigue → regular Fatigue, event log. ✅ **Perilous Locations added** — a Peril rating (journey setup) queues N extra Journey Events resolved via a red "🎲 Resolve Peril Event" button independent of the hex path; peril events are tagged ⚠️ [Peril] in the log (`resolveJourneyEvent(isPeril)`). Still missing: supplement-specific event tables (Rivendell etc.), per-hero Fatigue distribution (single-character app only tracks this hero). |
| Council | ~93% | ✅ Full Council tab added. Resistance 3/6/9, Audience Attitude ±1d, Introduction roll sets Time Limit, Interaction phase with 5 skill buttons + Roleplay Bonus picker, auto-end at Resistance met or Time Limit exhausted, Success/Failure/Success-with-Woe outcomes, roll log. ✅ **In-council Companion Support added** — `toggleCouncilSupport()` arms +1d on the next Interaction roll (one-shot). ✅ **Persistent council history added** — `char.councilHistory[]` keeps a summary of every closed council (topic/outcome/successes/attempts/day) in a "Past Councils" card with a clear button. Still missing: supplement-specific council bonuses. |
| Fellowship Phase | ~98% | ✅ Full 4-step wizard + 1-rank/Skill, 1-rank/Prof, Valour-XOR-Wisdom **enforced** in Spend XP modal during FP mode. +Heart/full Hope recovery, Shadow removal prompt, Yule extras (age +1, +WITS SP, full Hope), all 10 Undertakings with Calling-free indicators, mechanical effects for Strengthen Fellowship / Ponder Maps / Heal Scars / Raise an Heir / Write a Song / Visiting Treasury (dormant-quality unlock). Still missing: phase-duration mechanics (week-to-season window). |
| Treasure & Magical Items | ~99% | ✅ Hoard Roller, Treasure share with SoL auto-promote, Magical Treasure rolls, Add Item modal with Blessings + Famous quality picker, +2d auto on Blessing matches, Greed Shadow Test on tainted finds, Load +1 per item, Famous Weapon dormant-quality activation flow (manual Unlock + Visiting-Treasury integration), **Cursed Items** (Shadow Taint / Owned / Marked with red-border display + ⚠️ badge + Shadow-Taint auto-application in FP recovery), **Treasure Index** (15 curated canonical items: Glamdring/Orcrist/Sting/Andúril/Phial of Galadriel/etc., one-tap pre-fill of the Add modal). Effectively content-complete for player-side use. |
| Eye of Mordor | ~85% | ✅ Implemented as part of Strider Mode (visible when toggled on). Eye Awareness counter, Region picker (Border/Wild/Dark) with auto threshold (18/16/14), Hunt-threshold banner, full 12-entry Revelation Episode table rolled via Feat die, reset-to-starting helper that computes from culture + Valour + Famous items. **Still missing: auto-increment hooks** (raise on Eye outside combat, raise on Shadow gain outside combat, Magical Success → +1) — currently manual ± buttons. |
| Skill Endeavours | ~93% | ✅ Full Skill Endeavour section added to the Council tab. Resistance 3/6/9, Time Limit 3/4/5/6, Risk Level Standard/Hazardous/Foolish with branching outcomes, full 18-skill picker, Roleplay Bonus, auto-end at Resistance met or Time Limit exhausted. ✅ **Failure-with-Woe now auto-applies** — a failed Hazardous roll auto-applies +2 Fatigue (+1 Shadow on an Eye die) and logs it; a failed Foolish roll ends the endeavour immediately as a Disaster (`finalizeSkillEndeavour('disaster')`). Still missing: per-task progress persistence across the Adventuring Phase. |
| Resting/Healing | ~90% | ✅ Short Rest + Prolonged Rest buttons added with full RAW behaviour (Wounded reduction, 0 Hope → +1 on PR, Safe Haven Fatigue clearing). First Aid HEALING roll with day-countdown. ✅ **Day-tracker added** — `char.dayCount` + `char.shortRestUsedToday`: one Short Rest per day (override-able); a Prolonged Rest is the night's sleep that advances the day, clears the Short-Rest flag, and ticks a Wounded hero's `injuryDays` down by 1 (re-enabling First Aid). Status line on the Endurance card shows "📅 Day N · Short Rest available/used · 🩹 N injury days left". Still missing: nothing material for single-character play. |
| Experience awards | ~95% | ✅ End-Session button (+3 SP / +3 AP per RAW p.55). Yule WITS bonus already auto-applied via FP wizard step 2. Spend XP modal now enforces 1-rank-per-skill, 1-rank-per-prof, Valour-XOR-Wisdom when Fellowship Phase mode is active. Still missing: granular per-hour rate (1 SP+AP/hour, or 1.5/hour for fast-paced) — would need a session-timer; players can just tap End-Session button multiple times or adjust counters manually. |

## Moria Solo Mode (full subsystem reference)

The *Moria — Through the Doors of Durin* solo campaign, built as a **self-contained second solo mode** parallel to Strider Mode. Sources: the Moria **Solo Rules** chapter (Band, Battles, solo journeys, milestones, solo FP) + the Moria **Loremaster Rules** chapter (Chamber Generator, Revelation Episodes, Orc-Band Generator, Moria-Madness). All 8 build phases complete and browser-verified (2026-05-29). The two source markdowns + the old phased plan have been folded into this section — **this is the single source of truth**.

### Activation & precedence
- One menu toggle: **`toggleMoriaMode()`** (`⛏️ Enable Moria Solo Mode`). Sets `char.moriaMode`.
- Creation deltas on enable: **+5 max Hope** (band support, tracked/reversible via `char.moriaHopeBonus`), Patron → **Balin** (note), Fellowship ≥ 3, Safe Haven default "Moria — First Hall", `huntRegion = 'dark'` (Dark Land, Hunt 14), PE budget 15 (via `isSolo()`).
- **Precedence on shared surfaces:** `moriaMode → Moria · else striderMode → Strider · else normal`. Helpers `isMoria()` / `isSolo()` / `oracleSet()`. Moria & Strider are independent booleans (can both be on; Moria wins). TN-18 stays Strider-only (Moria RAW doesn't change the TN formula).
- Gating: `refreshStriderUI()` shows **Band + Battle tabs**, `.moria-only` cards, the shared-calling optgroup, and the Eye-of-Mordor card in Moria mode.

### Data model (on `char`, with load migration)
- `char.moriaMode`, `char.moriaHopeBonus`, `char.huntMod` (Hunt mods from prev-mission + FP duration), `char.shadowPathOrig` (Moria-Madness revert).
- `char.band = { readiness (TN = 20−readiness), dispositions{expertise,manoeuvre,rally,vigilance,war}, burden, sharedCalling, dispositionFocus, allies[] }`. Ally = `{ id, name, gift, giftDesc, quirk, hardened, injury, fatigue, outOfAction, kinglyGift:{name}|null, giftWasted }`.
- `char.mission = { active, objective, size, warGear, specialisation, prevOutcome, fpDuration, roster[] }` (empty roster = whole Band).
- `char.battle = { active, scale, foeMight, foeResistance, foeResMax, archfoe, objective, objectiveRes(Max), advantages[], complications[], leaderFocus, bandStance, inspired, focusBonus, fleeIll, round, log[] }`.

### Subsystems (as built)
- **Band tab** — Readiness/TN, 5 Disposition counters + roll buttons, Burden picker, Weary pill (auto when ≥ half the *mission roster* are out/serious). Ally roster: generate (Gift/Quirk/Name roll tables), per-ally injury/fatigue/hardened/out-of-action/**on-mission**/**Kingly-Gift** controls + **wasted-gift** badge. Endurance Test (Rally vs TN+DamageThreat) and Fatigue Test (Rally vs TN+pts ± Burden dice) → on fail apply/worsen the least-injured roster ally via `_applyInjuryFromFail` (shared with Clash failures). **Solo Tools** card: Hero-or-Band success-die roller (odd=Band, even=hero), Desperate Stand (pick ally → Favoured 2-Feat roll; an 👁 → survives, else lost +2 Shadow).
- **Dispositions** — rolled via `bandRoll()` (weary-aware; Eye auto-fails only when Miserable). Gift dropdown (+1d, **wasted on Eye**, Kingly variant re-rolls one Eye via `kinglyWard`), Hope spend (+1d, **+2d on the Disposition Focus** from the shared calling). `missionAllies()` scopes weary/picks to the roster.
- **Shared Callings** (5, in `CALLINGS` with `shared:true`) — Reclaimers/Pathfinders/Standard-Bearers/Guardians/Vanguards → Disposition Focus + 2-of-3 favoured + shadow path. Picked from the Build calling dropdown (Moria optgroup); `applyCalling` sets `char.band.dispositionFocus`.
- **Mission planning** card — objective roller, composition (Size/War Gear/Specialisation) → live-preview Dispositions/Burden/Readiness/EA/Hunt, prev-mission + FP-duration Hunt mods, ally roster picker. `applyMissionSetup` writes computed values.
- **Battle tab** — War Party (scale roller, Might/Resistance), Archfoe (Lesser/Greater), Objective Resistance, Battlefield Aspect, **Get-in-Position** → Advantage/Complication. **Clash loop**: Leader Focus (Command/Inspire/Fight/Duel) → Band Stance (Aggressive/Balanced/Guarded/Fleeing) → Clash roll (War/Manoeuvre vs TN+Might ± focus/advantages/complications/archfoe + gift/hope) → spend successes (−Foe/Objective Resistance, Advantage, remove Complication, Harry Archfoe). Failure → Endurance Test + all Advantages lost; Eye-fail → **Clash Setback** (d12, auto-applies Reinforcements +3 / Fell Presence +2 Shadow / persistent complications). Victory at foe Resistance 0. Duel = hand-off to Combat/Dice tabs.
- **Journeys** — `resolveJourneyEvent()` Moria branch (Ill-Favoured Dark Land; events 👁 Deadly Dark / 1-2 Long Dark / 3-5 Watchful Eyes / 6-9 Branching Stairs / 10 Right Way / ᚱ Dread & Wonder; 6 Event-Detail sub-tables; no roles, skill from detail; Branching-Stairs auto-rolls a Chamber). Marching Test auto-rolls TRAVEL for the solo Guide. Distance roller = (2 Success dice)×4 miles ÷2 = hexes.
- **Oracle generators** (Moria-only cards) — Random Chamber Generator (4 Feat-die tables → Type/Appearance/Condition/Challenge), Random Orc-Band (Feat leader + N success dice = party size, count field), Moria **Lore** (4-column Action/Aspect/Focus/Feature, `MORIA_LORE`, Feature button gated). Revelation Episodes (`rollRevelationEpisode` → `rollMoriaRevelation`): Success-die trigger (1-3 Dire / 4-5 Orc / 6 Terrors) + Ghâsh escalation, 4× d12 tables, fires on EA ≥ Hunt. Fortune/Ill-Fortune reuse the near-identical Strider tables.
- **Shadow** — shared pool; band loss → `gainBandShadow` (+1 Severe/Grievous, +2 lost). **Moria-Madness** alt shadow path (`toggleMoriaMadnessPath`, flaws Distracted/Mistrustful/Blinded/Jealous, reversible).
- **Milestones & Fellowship Phase** — milestone picker swaps to `MORIA_EXP_MILESTONES` in Moria mode. **Moria FP** (`moriaFP`, no Yule): Hurried/Brief/Extended recovery profiles (Hope by Heart vs full, Endurance, Shadow 1-3, wound heal, tiered band-condition clearing, **wasted-gift recovery**); FP Interruption roll (Eye → `FP_INTERRUPTIONS`); undertakings Recruit Allies + Reclaim Safe Haven; Refresh FP (Fellowship Milestone). **Kingly Gift** = give a Famous item to a Hardened ally (2nd gift + Eye-reroll ward).

### Key constants (grep these in `character-tracker.html`)
`DISPOSITIONS`, `SHARED_CALLINGS`, `ALLY_GIFTS`/`ALLY_QUIRKS`/`ALLY_NAMES`, `INJURY_ORDER`/`FATIGUE_ORDER`/`INJURY_SERIOUS`/`FATIGUE_SERIOUS`/`BURDEN_DICE`/`DAMAGE_THREAT`, `MISSION_OBJECTIVES`/`COMP_SIZE`/`COMP_WARGEAR`/`COMP_SPEC`/`EA_SIZE_MOD`/`HUNT_MOD_PREV`/`HUNT_MOD_FP`, `WAR_PARTY` (via `mapWarParty`)/`ARCHFOE_MODS`/`OBJECTIVE_RES`/`BATTLEFIELD_ASPECTS`/`CLASH_SETBACK`, `MORIA_JOURNEY_EVENTS`/`MORIA_EVENT_DETAILS`, `CHAMBER_TYPE`/`CHAMBER_CONDITION`/`CHAMBER_APPEARANCE`/`CHAMBER_CHALLENGE`/`REVELATION_MORIA`/`ORC_BAND_LEADER`/`ORC_BAND_MEMBER`, `MORIA_LORE`, `MORIA_EXP_MILESTONES`/`FP_INTERRUPTIONS`, `HUNT_THRESHOLDS`. `FLAWS_BY_PATH['Moria-Madness']`.

### Honest scope / deferrals
- **Duel** is a pointer to the existing Combat/Dice tabs (3 rounds vs Archfoe), not a re-implemented combat engine.
- Some **Clash Setback** follow-ups (AWARENESS/MANOEUVRE/RALLY rolls) are described, not auto-resolved; mechanical ones (Resistance +3, +Shadow, complications) auto-apply.
- **Rumours / Water Peril** tables from the Loremaster chapter are not yet in-app (low-priority flavour).
- Moria **Fortune/Ill-Fortune** reuse the Strider tables (≈identical text + same EA ±1/+2).

---

## Design Constraints

- **No build step** — must remain a plain HTML file openable from Files app
- **iOS Safari compatibility** — test all features in mobile Safari
- **Touch-first** — tap targets ≥ 32px, no hover-dependent UI
- **Offline-first** — never depend on a network request
- **Data preservation** — never destroy character data without explicit user confirmation
- **Single file unless necessary** — only split when file grows past ~200KB or maintenance becomes painful

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

- ~~**Brawling proficiency not in COMBAT_PROFS** — Brawling weapons (Unarmed/Dagger/Cudgel/Club) exist in WEAPONS but the proficiency isn't tracked. Per rules Brawling uses the highest combat prof at −1d.~~ ✅ **Fixed.** Brawling now appears in the quick-roll grid as a derived prof (`getBrawlingRating()` = `max(other profs) − 1`).
- ~~**Conditional virtue effects** (Dragon-Slayer, Sure at the Mark, Defiance, etc.) shown in description but not automatically applied during rolls — relies on player to remember. Adding all as toggles would clutter dice tab.~~ ✅ **Partially fixed (2026-05-27).** 6 auto-applies + 2 toggles wired:
  - **Auto (no UI, fires only if virtue owned + context matches):** Sure at the Mark (Bows attack → Favoured), Against the Unseen (Dread Shadow Test → Favoured), Strength of Will (Dread Shadow Test → +1d), Untameable Spirit (Sorcery Shadow Test → +1d), Stone-Hard (Protection → Favoured unless Miserable), Skin-Coat (Protection + leather/none armour → +1d).
  - **Toggles on Dice tab (only shown if virtue owned):** Dragon-Slayer (🐉 Foe is Might 2+ → Favoured attack), Dark for Dark Business (🌑 Dark/Underground → Inspired, source-tracked alongside Brave/Invoke-DF).
  - **Still narrative-only:** Defiance (end-of-combat End recovery), Desperate Courage (Hope+Shadow→Inspired), Brother to Bears (Brawling −1d cancel), Bree-Pony, Heir of Arnor, Royalty Revealed, Tough as Old Tree-Roots, Memory of Ancient Days, plus all flat-passive virtues (Small Folk, Durin's Way) that don't fit dice-tab toggles. Helper `hasVirtue(name)` available for future hooks.
- ~~**Spiteful Shadow Path** has Wandering-Madness flaws (Spiteful/Brutal/Cruel/Murderous). The 7-column cheat sheet table is ambiguous; current mapping is best-effort.~~ **Fixed:** the original mapping was shifted by one column. Per Core Rules p.140 the correct mapping is now in `FLAWS_BY_PATH`: Curse of Vengeance (Champion) → Spiteful/Brutal/Cruel/Murderous; Dragon-Sickness (Treasure Hunter) → Grasping/Mistrustful/Deceitful/Thieving; Lure of Power (Captain) → Resentful/Arrogant/Overconfident/Tyrannical; Lure of Secrets (Scholar) → Haughty/Scornful/Scheming/Traitorous; Path of Despair (Warden) → Troubled/Wavering/Guilt-ridden/Fearful; Wandering-Madness (Messenger) → Idle/Forgetful/Uncaring/Cowardly.
- **Combat Proficiency XP costs** in Spend XP modal use the in-game `XP_COST_TO_REACH` table (4/8/12/20/26/30). Character creation Previous Experience costs (1-5 SP, 2/4/6 AP) are not exposed since pre-XP-spend is part of Build.
- **Attribute Growth via new Valour/Wisdom rank** not yet implemented — the cheat sheet hints at it but rules need confirmation. For now, attribute ratings are locked.
- **Native `confirm()` / `alert()`** used throughout — less polished than custom modals. ✅ **Styled modal infrastructure added** (`showModal` / `confirmStyled` / `alertStyled`); migration of existing native calls deferred (would cascade sync→async through many functions). New features should use the styled helpers.
- **Rewards re-equipping** — if you change armour/shield after applying Close-fitting / Cunning Make / Reinforced, the reward's reference becomes stale. Manual revert + reapply needed.

### Action Resolution rules deviations / gaps (the ~1% the coverage matrix flags)

- ~~**Brave at a Pinch is more generous than RAW.**~~ ✅ **Fixed.** Now sets Inspired state; Inspired doubles a Hope spend to +2d (per RAW p.20). No bonus without Hope spend.
- ~~**Inspiration as a generic state is not modeled.**~~ ✅ **Fixed.** Added "✨ Invoke Distinctive Feature" button on dice tab that sets Inspired with source "Distinctive Feature". Player narrates which DF they're invoking.
- ~~**Give-side Support button missing.**~~ ✅ **Fixed.** "🤝 Support Ally" mini-button added under the Hope counter on Character tab.
- ~~**Favoured vs Ill-Favoured cancellation not auto-computed.**~~ ✅ **Fixed (2026-05-27).** `diceState.autoFavSources` / `autoIllSources` arrays track every auto source (cultural blessings, conditional virtues, skill's own Favoured flag, Dragon-Slayer toggle, etc.). New `effectiveFav()` helper layers them against the manual seg-btn pick per RAW p.20 — any-Fav + any-Ill → cancel to Normal. `rollFeatDie` and `pickFeat` use the effective state. A `#fav-cancel-hint` element under the Feat-die picker surfaces auto-Favoured sources by default, and flips to a "⚖ {fav-list} ⇄ {ill-list} — cancel to Normal" warning when an opposing pick layers. The result summary also gets a "⚖ Cancelled: … → rolled Normal" tag when it fires. `autoIllSources` is empty today (no auto-Ill rules in the catalog yet) but the plumbing is in place for future Ill-Favoured triggers (e.g. Sorcery debuffs, foe abilities).
- **Repeating-a-Roll rules not enforced.** RAW: cannot re-attempt the same skill action unless circumstances change in a meaningful way. The app doesn't track or block re-rolls. Probably correct to leave as player-tracker behaviour.

---

## Local Development

```bash
# Just open the file in a browser
open "character-tracker.html"

# Or serve locally (optional, for testing PWA features)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000/character-tracker.html
```

---

## Deployment

The project folder contains **two copies** of the app for different deploy paths:
- `character-tracker.html` — canonical edit target. All edits should be made here first.
- `index.html` — duplicate kept in sync for hosted deploys (Netlify serves it at root URL).

After every meaningful edit to `character-tracker.html`, **sync the copy**:

```bash
cp "character-tracker.html" "index.html"
```

(Claude should run this automatically after every batch of changes that the user is likely to deploy.)

### 🟢 Path 1 — Netlify Drop (recommended, real HTTPS PWA)

**Initial deploy (Mac):**
1. Open https://app.netlify.com/drop in a browser
2. Drag the entire `TOR2E Tracker` folder onto the drop zone
3. Wait ~20 seconds → Netlify gives a URL like `https://random-name.netlify.app`
4. Click **"Claim this site"** → sign in with email or GitHub (free)
5. **Site Settings → Change site name** for a memorable URL

**Redeploy after an update:**
- Either drag the folder onto the same site's **Deploys** page in Netlify dashboard
- Or connect the folder to a Git repo (later upgrade)

**Install on iPhone/iPad:**
1. Open the Netlify URL in **Safari**
2. Tap **Share** (square + ↑) → **Add to Home Screen** → **Add**
3. Red-ring "TOR" icon appears on Home Screen — launches fullscreen as a PWA

### 🟡 Path 2 — iCloud Drive direct (fallback, no hosting)

The file is in iCloud Drive so it syncs automatically to iOS devices.

**On iPhone/iPad:**
1. Open **Files** app → navigate to `iCloud Drive → iCloud Downloads → Coding → TOR2E Tracker`
2. Tap `character-tracker.html` — opens in iOS HTML preview
3. Tap **Share** → **"Open in Safari"**
4. In Safari: **Share** → **Add to Home Screen**

⚠️ iOS Safari treats `file://` PWAs with limited support — the Home Screen icon may behave more like a bookmark than a true fullscreen PWA. Path 1 (Netlify) is preferred for proper PWA experience.

### What `Add to Home Screen` provides

Already correctly configured via meta tags in `<head>`:
- `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` → fullscreen launch (no Safari chrome)
- `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` → status bar themed parchment-cream
- `apple-mobile-web-app-title` → "TOR2E" displayed under the icon
- `apple-touch-icon` → inline SVG data-URI showing red TOR ring on parchment
- `viewport-fit=cover` + `safe-area-inset-*` CSS → proper notch handling on newer iPhones

### Updating an installed PWA

When the deployed version changes:
1. The Home Screen-installed app uses Safari's cache by default
2. To force-refresh: open the URL in Safari, long-press reload → **"Request without cache"**
3. In rare cases: delete the Home Screen icon and re-add from Safari
4. **localStorage character data persists** across these refreshes — only an explicit browser-data clear (or Reset Character in the app menu) wipes it

### Backup workflow

Before any major update, the user can export their character via the ☰ Menu → **Export Character (JSON)**. The JSON file can be saved to iCloud Drive or emailed. Restore via the same menu's **Import**.

## File Layout

```
TOR2E Tracker/
├── character-tracker.html              # canonical edit target — all changes start here
├── index.html                          # mirror of character-tracker.html for hosted deploys
├── sw.js · manifest.json · icon-*.png/svg  # PWA service worker + install assets
├── CLAUDE.md                            # this file — single source of truth (incl. full Moria subsystem ref)
├── MD FIles/                            # extracted rulebook markdown (source reference for Claude)
│   ├── Moria - Solo Rules.md · Moria - Rules.md
│   └── (Strider Mode, etc.)
└── *.pdf                               # original rulebook PDFs (Core Rules, Cheat Sheet, supplements)
```

**Workflow rule for Claude**: after any batch of edits to `character-tracker.html`, run `cp character-tracker.html index.html` to keep the deployed mirror in sync, and bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js`. Mention the deployed file is updated when reporting completed work.

Future structure if we ever split (only if file becomes unmaintainable):

```

├── app.js
├── data/

│   ├── callings.js
│   ├── weapons.js
│   ├── rewards.js
